# 📊 Project 1: Netflix Data Analysis using Python

Welcome to **Project 1** of my Data Analysis journey with Python!  
This project explores Netflix movie data to answer interesting questions about genres, popularity, ratings, and production trends. Using **pandas**, **matplotlib**, and **seaborn**, I cleaned the dataset, performed exploratory data analysis (EDA), and visualized key insights.

## ❓ Questions Explored

1. **What is the most frequent genre of movies released on Netflix?**  
2. **Which movie has the highest average votes (`vote_avg`)?**  
3. **What movie got the highest popularity? What’s its genre?**  
4. **What movie got the lowest popularity? What’s its genre?**  
5. **Which year has the most movies filmed or released?**

## 📊 Key Insights

- The **most frequent genre** is most likely **Drama**, followed by **Comedy**.
- The **highest voted movie** indicates strong user reception.
- The **most popular movie** doesn’t always align with the highest vote average.
- The **least popular movie** provides insight into content that failed to engage viewers.
- The **year with the most movies** reveals trends in Netflix’s production or acquisition.
